This user friendly program allows patients arriving to a dental office for their appointments to check-in. 
The function is created to print out the validation to the patient that they have successfully checked in and will be called in to see the doctor shortly.
Several input statements are implemented to gather the information of the patient and use it to properly check them in.
Finally, the program tells the user to have a seat while the office prepares to attend to the patient.
